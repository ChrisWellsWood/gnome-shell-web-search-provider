# Web Search Provider for GNOME Shell

This GNOME Shell extension enables you to search the web directly from the shell overview.

It is very much a work in progress.

## Installation

1.  To install, clone this repository into the folder for locally installed GNOME Shell extensions:

    ```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/mrakow/gnome-shell-web-search-provider ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/web-search-provider@mrakow.github.com
```
2.  Restart GNOME Shell by typing <kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F2</kbd></kbd>, <kbd>r</kbd>, and then <kbd><kbd>Enter</kbd></kbd>.
3.  Enable the Web Search Provider extension in GNOME Tweak Tool or at <https://extensions.gnome.org/local>.

## Usage

The extension is not yet usable.

## Acknowledgements

As development documentation for GNOME Shell search providers is sparse, I have based this extension on [Wikidata Search Provider](https://github.com/bmansurov/wikidata-search-provider) by Bahodir Mansurov.
